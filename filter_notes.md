1. **Activation Threshold**: block only when the violation is clear and substantial, not for incidental mentions or educational/informative contextualization of sensitive topics.
2. **Academic Context**: analytical discussions on ethical topics, moral dilemmas, or case studies must not be blocked if the tone is neutral and the purpose is educational.
3. **Precautionary Principle**: in case of significant doubt, proceed with blocking and defer detailed analysis to semantic search on the original documents.
